# oop-examples

Examples for introducing Object-Oriented Programming in JS and TS.

* 1: module with drawing functions
* 2: handle objects as parameters
* 2b: (made easy by the above) add animation
* 3: put functions into objects, export only creator functions
* 3b: now we can treat both lines and circles as the same
* 3c: and we can still put extra stuff in the objects (rotateBy)
