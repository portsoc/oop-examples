# oop-examples

Examples for introducing Object-Oriented Programming in JS and TS.

* 1: module with drawing functions
* 2: handle objects as parameters
  * (made easy by the above) …add animation
* 3: put functions into objects, export only creator functions
  * …now we can treat both lines and circles as the same
* 4: put moving into circles
  * …generate random bubbles
  * …and we can still put extra stuff in the objects (dx, dy)

## todo
