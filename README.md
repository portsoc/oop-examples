# OOP Examples

Examples for introducing Object-Oriented Programming in JS and TS.

1. module with drawing functions
2. handle objects as parameters
   * …add animation (made easy by the above)
3. put functions into objects, export only creator functions
   * …now we can treat both lines and circles as the same
4. put moving into circles
   * …generate random bubbles
   * …and we can still put extra stuff in the objects (dx, dy)
5. classes
6. inheritance
7. polymorphism example with `toString()`
8. gotcha: `this` parameter can get lost if we're not careful
9. getters
10. typescript
